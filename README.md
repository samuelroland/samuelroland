1. [**Delibay**](https://delibay.org): An open-source learning platform based on deliberate practice principles for IT students and their teachers, focused on practice and feedback. I develop it on [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/delibay) to avoid Github.

1. [**openDevApps**](https://github.com/samuelroland/openDevApps#readme) - **Open quickly local or remote development-related apps, through a small list of links.**

1. [**docs**](https://github.com/samuelroland/docs#readme) - **Personal documentation and notes about programming languages, resource lists, or created files. Mostly in french.**
