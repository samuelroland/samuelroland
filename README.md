# Hi, I'm Samuel Roland !

## üíª A curious and hardworking student developer with a passion for FOSS, side projects, designing and building applications, and sharing experiences.

### üñ•Ô∏è üôÇ Here are the most interesting dev projects I work on (finished or under development):
1. [**KanFF**](https://github.com/samuelroland/KanFF#readme) - An opensource web application to manage projects with kanban boards, for groups, collectives and associations.  
*A fascinating project to help manage other projects inside more or less big collectives.*
1. [**kanff.org**](https://kanff.org) - The landing page for the KanFF project.  
*Lot of works to design with Tailwindcss, write and choose screenshots on the first landing page I've created.*
1. [**openDevApps**](https://github.com/samuelroland/openDevApps#readme) - Open quickly local or remote development-related apps, through a small list of links.  
*My first web extension built with VueJS as a solution for a personal need.*
1. [**docs**](https://github.com/samuelroland/docs#readme) - Personal documentations and notes about programming languages, ressource lists or created files. Mostly in french.  
*The goal is to write down and vulgarize the things I learn, the memorize and understand them better and maybe help other developers in their learnings...*
